Day 1: 12/8
  Made roll dice function and score calculator. The roll dice function was copy and paste from a previous mission, which is always a great way to start (I was expecially happy because this meant I wouldn't have to create any doc string). The score calculator also had some simularities to the previous Yahtzee simulator, however, there are some different scoring rules that made things more difficult (for example, a full house and two three of a kind are scored differently). I needed my function to be able to score a rolls with the number of dice ranging from 1 to 6, so I used some if-else logic to eliminate scoring based on the number of dice. After some effort, I discovered the previous logic used for the Yahtzee simulator does not apply well in this function, so I had to switch my approach, which was a little fusterating. I instead made a dictionary that counted the number if appearances of each dice face, and then manipulated that to complete the score function.

Day 2: 12/9
  Made basic interactive game simulator and built a shell for the game optimizer function. Creating the game player was a lot more fun and intertaining, and a lot more rewarding since in the end I had something that was kind of fun and that I could show off. In addition, the game play function ran without errors and was pretty straightfoward, yet already I have a farkle simulator. The optimize game took a lot more effert to logic out it's interaction with the game play function, even if it always returns bank all by returning all of the bankable dice. Setting up the dictionary in the score function above definitely made my life easier here, so I kind of gave myself a pat on the back for that one.

Day 3: 12/10
  I updated all the blog for the first time! I also spent some time logicing out the optimizing function and checking out numpy and scipy modules for probablity.
